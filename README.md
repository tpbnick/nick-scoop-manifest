[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/) Manifest and Install Script

Powershell install:
`.\scoop-install.ps1`

Run either `scoop update <app_name>` to update a specific app or `scoop update *` to update all apps (after they are installed).

The scoop-update.bat file is something I keep on my desktop to quickly update all apps with just a double-click.

Currently contains the following apps:

- 7zip
- authy
- discord
- eartrumpet
- espanso
- everything
- firefox-developer
- git
